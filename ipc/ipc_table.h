 *	The is_table_next field of an ipc_space_t points to

 *	be elements of an array, ipc_table_entries.
 *
 *	The array must end with two elements with the same its_size value.
 *	Except for the terminating element, the its_size values must
 *	be strictly increasing.  The largest (last) its_size value
 *	must be less than or equal to MACH_PORT_INDEX(MACH_PORT_DEAD).
 *	This ensures that
 *		1) MACH_PORT_INDEX(MACH_PORT_DEAD) isn't a valid index
 *		in the table, so ipc_entry_get won't allocate it.
 *		2) MACH_PORT_MAKE(index+1, 0) and MAKE_PORT_MAKE(size, 0)
 *		won't ever overflow.
 *
 *
 *	The ipr_size field of the first element in a table of
 *	dead-name requests (ipc_port_request_t) points to the
 *	ipc_table_size structure.  The structures must be elements
 *	of ipc_table_dnrequests.  ipc_table_dnrequests must end
 *	with an element with zero its_size, and except for this last
 *	element, the its_size values must be strictly increasing.
 *
 *	The is_table_next field points to the ipc_table_size structure
 *	for the next larger size of table, not the one currently in use.
