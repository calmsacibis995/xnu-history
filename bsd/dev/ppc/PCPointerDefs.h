//
// The following structure defines an event on the pointer.
// We pass events of this form to the object registered as
// our event target.
//
typedef struct _t_PointerEvent {
    ns_time_t timeStamp; // When did this event happen
    int buttonCount;

//
// The following protocol must be implemented by any class that wishes to
// receive pointer events. When such a class wishes to receive events it
// invokes the setEventTarget: method of the PCPointer instance specifying
// itself as the target. When the PCPointer instance has an event to dispatch,
// it will invoke the dispatchMouseEvent: method defined in this protocol.
