typedef struct _t_PCKeyboardEvent {

// The following protocol is implemented by PCKeyboard objects. Clients
// of the PCKeyboard can invoke the methods below to indicate their
// ownership of the PCKeyboard object.
//
@protocol PCKeyboardExported

- (IOReturn)becomeOwner		: client;
// Description:	Register for event dispatch via device-specific protocol.
//		(See the dispatchKeyboardEvent method)
//		Returns IO_R_SUCCESS if successful, else IO_R_BUSY. The
//		relinquishOwnershipRequest: method may be called on another
//		client during the execution of this method.

- (IOReturn)relinquishOwnership	: client;
// Description:	Relinquish ownership. Returns IO_R_BUSY if caller is not
//		current owner.


- (IOReturn)desireOwnership	: client;
// Description:	Request notification (via canBecomeOwner:) when
//		relinquishOwnership: is called. This allows one potential
//		client to place itself "next in line" for ownership. The
//		queue is only one deep.

@end	// PCKeyboardExported


//
// The following protocol is implemented by clients of the PCKeyboard
// object. A PCKeyboard instance will invoke these methods to indicate
// that an event has come in or that a change in ownership can happen.
//
@protocol PCKeyboardImported

- (void)dispatchKeyboardEvent:(PCKeyboardEvent *)event;
// Description:	Called when the keyboard object receives a new keyboard
//		Event. The event structure should not be freed by the callee.


- (IOReturn)relinquishOwnershipRequest	: device;
// Description:	Called when another client wishes to assume ownership of
//		calling kbd Device. This happens when a client attempts a
//		becomeOwner: on a device which is  owned by the callee of
//		this method. 
// Returns:
//		IO_R_SUCCESS ==> It's OK to give ownership of the device to
//				 other client. In this case, callee no longer
//				 owns the device.
//		IO_R_BUSY    ==> Don't transfer ownership.


- (IOReturn)canBecomeOwner			: device;
// Description:	Method by which a client, who has registered "intent to own"
//		via desireOwnership:client, is notified that the calling
//		device is available. Client will typically call becomeOwner:
//		during this call.
