		(BWS)	Brent Schorsch
		(BG)	Bill Galcher
		(CJK)	Craig Keithley

	Change History (most recent first):

	 <USB32>	 6/20/98	CJK		Expand on Brent's comments... It wasn't a "fix" of the refcon,
									it was the addition of a new getinfo selector so that an
									InputSprocket can ask the Keyboard HID Module to pass back it's
									refcon to the caller. There was nothing "broken" in the original
									code.
	 <USB31>	 6/18/98	BWS		fix interrupt refcon support
	 <USB30>	 6/18/98	CJK		update to use modified HID dispatch table (passing in refcon)
	 <USB29>	  6/5/98	CJK		remove pragma unused from GetKeysPressed
	 <USB28>	 5/28/98	CJK		add HID GetInfo Selector to get notification proc address
	 <USB27>	 5/20/98	CJK		change driver name from USBKeyboardModule to
									USBHIDKeyboardModule
	 <USB26>	 5/20/98	CJK		add check for 'DDKBuild' define. If it's not defined then it's
									okay to include USBPriv.h and use the USL's DoneQueue API.
	 <USB25>	 5/19/98	CJK		remove include of USBPriv.h. This file should not be included,
									as the DDK will not supply it. If there are prototypes needed by
									this file, they should be moved to USB.h (usb.i).
	 <USB24>	 5/19/98	BG		Add includes of <USBPriv.h> and "UIMPriv.h" to bring in needed
									prototypes.
	 <USB23>	 5/18/98	CJK		remove the breaks...
	 <USB22>	 5/18/98	CJK		Add support for 'GetCurrentKeyboardState' getinfo selector
	 <USB21>	 4/30/98	CJK		fix break statements.
	 <USB20>	 4/30/98	CJK		handle keyreleasedflag slightly differently
	 <USB19>	 4/30/98	CJK		add a "send raw report" mode.  rework so that the old hid report
									and initialized flags are kept in the keyboard data structure
									(rather than in static vars.)
	 <USB18>	 4/27/98	CJK		correct zero'ing of non-relevant hid report bytes.
	 <USB17>	 4/27/98	CJK		Add handling of key rollover errors.  No longer sends already
									down keys when the rollover error is removed.
	 <USB16>	 4/26/98	CJK		update to match reworked keyboard interface driver.
									Restructured user notification routine.
	 <USB15>	 4/14/98	CJK		change call to USBIdleTask to UIMProcessDoneQueue
	 <USB14>	  4/9/98	CJK		remove include of USBDeviceDefines.h
		<13>	  4/8/98	CJK		add enable/disable of emulation code
		<12>	 3/26/98	CJK		remove debugstr
		<11>	 3/17/98	CJK		change }; to just }. MetroWerks has a problem with };.  Also
									added parens around pragma unused's variable name.
		<10>	 3/12/98	CJK		Don't worry about initializing the shim keyboard paramblock.
									That's done in the keyboard initialize routine.
		 <9>	  3/2/98	CJK		remove include of KBDHIDEmulation.h
		 <8>	  3/2/98	CJK		change to use USBHIDModule hid data structure (rather than the
									keyboard data structure).
		 <7>	 2/27/98	CJK		add check for keycount growing too large.  Add include of
									USBHIDModules.h.  Change LED control selector to be "by bit" (as
									opposed to by ID, which is probably how things will ultimately
									work).
		 <6>	 2/26/98	CJK		Add USBHIDControlDevice functionality. All it does (right now)
									is set the LEDs.
		 <5>	 2/17/98	CJK		Integrate Ferg's changes.
		<4*>	 2/16/98	DKF		Add keyposting if there is no shim registered
		 <4>	 2/16/98	CJK		remove write of $00 keycodes into the keycode array. Streamline
									old vs. new keycode detection (hopefully faster than before).
		 <3>	 2/16/98	CJK		Improve check of modifier key changes (shouldn't need to scan
									through each bit to determine if any modifiers changed.  Just check
									the changed bits.  If any changed, then look through each bit individually.
		 <2>	 2/10/98	CJK		Correct change history (to reflect the keyboard module changes)
		 <1>	 2/10/98	CJK		First time checkin.  Cloned from Mouse HID Module.
