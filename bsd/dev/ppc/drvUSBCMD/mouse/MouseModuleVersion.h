	Change History (most recent first):

	  <USB5>	 5/13/98	CJK		fix version info to get version from packageversion.h if the
									individual version has been overridden
	  <USB4>	 5/11/98	CJK		remove semicolon after include statement
		 <3>	  3/6/98	CJK		change so that the check for the override of the version occurs
									here, and not in the .r file.
		 <2>	  3/5/98	CJK		Fix version string problems
