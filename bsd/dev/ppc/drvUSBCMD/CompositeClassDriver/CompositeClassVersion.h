    This file is used in these builds:  

	Change History (most recent first):

	  <USB3>	 5/13/98	CJK		fix version info to get version from packageversion.h if the
									individual version has been overridden
	  <USB2>	 5/11/98	CJK		remove semicolon after include statement
		 <1>	  4/7/98	CJK		first checked in
		 <3>	  3/6/98	CJK		change to use the override individual versions flag to determine
									whether the version info comes from the packageversion file or
									from this file.
		 <2>	  3/5/98	CJK		Work on version string formatting (so that the correct strings
									appear when doing a get info).
