	Change History (most recent first):

	  <USB5>	 6/29/98	CJK		change total length so that it's properly byte swapped.
	  <USB4>	  6/5/98	CJK		remove XXGetEndPointDescriptor function (not needed)
	  <USB3>	 5/19/98	BG		Fix some casting problems.
	  <USB2>	  4/9/98	CJK		change to use USB.h
		 <1>	  4/7/98	CJK		first checked in as USBCompositeClassDriver
		 <8>	 3/17/98	CJK		Replace "};" with just "}" (where required by MW).  Also used
									extractprototypes to get the function prototypes out of this
									file and into the header file.
		 <7>	  3/9/98	CJK		Fix RADAR #2216609 (Duplicate sets of enums)
		 <6>	  2/9/98	CJK		remove get hid descriptor function
		 <5>	  2/9/98	CJK		remove HIDEmulation.h include
		 <4>	  2/2/98	CJK		Add get hid descriptor call
		 <3>	 1/26/98	CJK		Change to use structure field names as required by codebert
		 <2>	 1/23/98	CJK		Work on configuration parsing
