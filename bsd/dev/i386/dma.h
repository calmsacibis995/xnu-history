 **********************************************************************
 * HISTORY
 *
 * 26-Sep-89  John Seamons (jks) at NeXT
 *	Made dd_csr in struct dma_dev an int (and changed the corresponding
 *	register #defines) because this register responds as a 32-bit device
 *	and therefore needs to be accessed this way to work on the 68040.
 *
 * 12-Apr-88  John Seamons (jks) at NeXT
 *	Changes to support DMA chip 313.
 *
 * 12-Aug-87  Mike DeMoney (mike) at NeXT
 *	Created.
