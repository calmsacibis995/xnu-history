 * This code is written to operate with two timers which run
 * independently of each other. The main clock, running at hz
 * times per second, is used to do scheduling and timeout calculations.
 * The second timer does resource utilization estimation statistically
 * based on the state of the machine phz times a second. Both functions
 * can be performed by a single clock (ie hz == phz), however the 
 * statistics will be much more prone to errors. Ideally a machine
 * would have separate clocks measuring time spent in user state, system
 * state, interrupt state, and idle state. These clocks would allow a non-
 * approximate measure of resource utilization.
