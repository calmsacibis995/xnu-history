	BTScanState - This structure is used to keep track of the current state
	of a BTree scan.  It contains both the dynamic state information (like
	the current node number and record number) and information that is static
	for the duration of a scan (such as buffer pointers).
	
	NOTE: recordNum may equal or exceed the number of records in the node
	number nodeNum.  If so, then the next attempt to get a record will move
	to a new node number.
