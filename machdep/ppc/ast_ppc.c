 *
 * HISTORY
 *
 *	umeshv@apple.com
 *	Fixed sleep integration problem. sleep was not properly
 *	handling thread states of THREAD_INTERRUPTED and 
 *	THREAD_MUST_TERMINATE, so callers of sleep were getting
 *	confused and many times looping.  This fixes the (in)famous
 *	unkillable gdb problem, the PB (and other processes) don't
 *	terminate, and more. Cleaned up ast code to be just like
 *  i386 version.
