 *	int bcmp(const void *b1, const void *b2, size_t len)
 *
 *	DESCRIPTION
 *		The bcmp() function compares byte string b1 against byte string
 *		b2, returning zero if they are identical, non-zero otherwise.
 *		Both strings are assumed to be len bytes long.
 *		Zero-length strings are always identical.
 *
 *		The strings may overlap.
