 * 
 * The mechanism chosen is fairly standard - a primary interrupt fielder
 * is used which detects the source of the incoming interrupt and thus its
 * priority. This routine will either allow the interrupt to pass to
 * its handler if it is above the current priority, or queue it if it is
 * not. A word of 32 bits is used for queue flags, thus determining the
 * number of interrupt levels available.

 * Notes:
 *	- software prohibits more than one machine-dependent SPL per bit on
 *	  a given architecture (e.g. ppc).  In cases where there
 *	  are multiple equivalent devices which interrupt at the same level
 *	  (e.g. ASP RS232 #1 and #2), the interrupt table insertion routine
 *	  will always add in the unit number (arg0) to offset the entry.
 *	- hard clock must be the first bit (i.e. 0x80000000).
 *	- SPL7 is any non-zero value (since the PSW I-bit is off).
 *	- SPLIMP serves two purposes: blocks network interfaces and blocks
 *	  memory allocation via malloc.  In theory, SPLLAN would be high
 *TODONMGS	  enough.  However, on the hp700, the SCSI driver uses malloc at
 *TODONMGS	  interrupt time requiring SPLIMP >= SPLBIO.  On the 800, we are
 *	  still using HP-UX drivers which make the assumption that
 *	  SPLIMP >= SPLCIO.  New drivers would address both problems.
