/*
 *	Locking Protocols:
 *
 *	There are two structures in the pmap module that need locking:
 *	the pmaps themselves, and the per-page pv_lists (which are locked
 *	by locking the pv_lock_table entry that corresponds to the pv_head
 *	for the list in question.)  Most routines want to lock a pmap and
 *	then do operations in it that require pv_list locking -- however
 *	pmap_remove_all and pmap_copy_on_write operate on a physical page
 *	basis and want to do the locking in the reverse order, i.e. lock
 *	a pv_list and then go through all the pmaps referenced by that list.
 *	To protect against deadlock between these two cases, the pmap_lock
 *	is used.  There are three different locking protocols as a result:
 *
 *  1.  pmap operations only (pmap_extract, pmap_access, ...)  Lock only
 *		the pmap.
 *
 *  2.  pmap-based operations (pmap_enter, pmap_remove, ...)  Get a read
 *		lock on the pmap_lock (shared read), then lock the pmap
 *		and finally the pv_lists as needed [i.e. pmap lock before
 *		pv_list lock.]
 *
 *  3.  pv_list-based operations (pmap_remove_all, pmap_copy_on_write, ...)
 *		Get a write lock on the pmap_lock (exclusive write); this
 *		also guaranteees exclusive access to the pv_lists.  Lock the
 *		pmaps as needed.
 *
 *	At no time may any routine hold more than one pmap lock or more than
 *	one pv_list lock.  Because interrupt level routines can allocate
 *	mbufs and cause pmap_enter's, the pmap_lock and the lock on the
 *	kernel_pmap can only be held at splvm.
 *	
 *	The dev_addr list is protected by using a write lock on the 
 *	pmap_lock.  Lookups are expected to be cheap.
