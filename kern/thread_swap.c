 *
 *	Mach thread swapper:
 *		Find idle threads to swap, freeing up kernel stack resources
 *		at the expense of allowing them to execute.
 *
 *		Swap in threads that need to be run.  This is done here
 *		by the swapper thread since it cannot be done (in general)
 *		when the kernel tries to place a thread on a run queue.
 *
 *	Note: The act of swapping a thread in Mach does not mean that
 *	its memory gets forcibly swapped to secondary storage.  The memory
 *	for the task corresponding to a swapped thread is paged out
 *	through the normal paging mechanism.
