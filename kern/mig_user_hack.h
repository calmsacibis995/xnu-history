 * This file is meant to be imported with
 *	uimport <kern/mig_user_hack.h>;
 * by those interfaces for which the kernel (but not builtin tasks)
 * is the client.  See memory_object.defs and memory_object_default.defs.
 * It has the hackery necessary to make Mig-generated user-side stubs
 * usable by the kernel.
 *
 * The uimport places a
 *	#include <kern/mig_user_hack.h>
 * in the generated header file for the interface, so any file which
 * includes the interface header file will get these definitions,
 * not just the user stub file like we really want.
